    I set the coordinates to my time zone. It&#39;s the weekend where I&#39;m from. The Lab must be empty. Lester asks innocently, &quot; Should I pack anything? &quot;. I laugh and reply, &quot; We&#39;re not going on a vacation, Lester &quot;. He frowned as if he was in kindergarten, being called out for his mischief. 
    &quot; Are you ready? &quot;, I ask him before we set off. &quot; More than ever &quot;, he replies confidently. For a moment I had second thoughts about taking him to the Lab, but I suppose it doesn&#39;t make much of a difference. 
    
    We set off- to his future, and my present.
    
    
    We materialize in the Lab. I show him around. He marvels at all our equipment. He is amazed by the infrastructure of the Lab. This is our first field trip together. He walks around frantically trying to learn as much as he can. He tries out the dematerializer and can&#39;t materialize for five minutes straight .Our first field trip together, and our last. Why did he even agree to this plan?
    
    After a couple of hours of watching my grandfather running about my labratory, it is finally time.
    
    &quot; Lester! &quot;, I call out. He comes over to me and I tell him that his time is up. &quot; We must proceed with the experiment &quot;. It feels hard for me to say that, but not hard enough to change my mind. I have decided.
    &quot;I understand&quot;, he replies with a smiling face. 
    
    We materialize back at Lester&#39;s home. Lester goes to his kitchen and takes a picture out from the drawer. He kisses it and places it back there.
    
    He stands in front of me and nods that he&#39;s ready. I take out my blaster and aim it at him. I shoot. Lester dies. I should have asked him why he agreed to this
