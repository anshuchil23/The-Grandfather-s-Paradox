    &quot;Oh goodie!!&quot;, he exclaims. Lester&#39;s face, lit even brighter now by the afternoon sun, is filled with pure joy.

    He pours me a second cup of tea and brings out the crackers from the kitchen cabinet.
    
     Going by the year, Lester must be just about my age now. And yet, he&#39;s almost like a child; always curious, always asking questions. 
    
    I tell him about how far technology has come. I tell him about the world crises that we solved. I tell him that there is hope for the future. And yet, I will have to kill him. Nevertheless, as men of science, we both understand fully just how important this experiment is for mankind. After all, I just might be giving up my own life by doing this. Who knows what will happen to me after Lester dies. We both realize the gravity of the situation we are in. 
    Perhaps that is why I feel so at home. Perhaps Lester is the only person in the world who faces the same fears I do.
    I start telling him about my Lab and the experiments with time travel I conducted.
    I would have loved to work with him in my lab back home. 
    
    Almost as if hearing my inner thoughts, Lester interrupts, &quot; Can I see it? &quot;.
    I show him a picture of the Lab.
    He pouts funnily and replies, &quot; I mean in person. Could I travel with you to the future to see the Lab &quot;. His expression changes, &quot; W-W-We could come back immediately after. I-I don&#39;t think that will change the timeline too much. But what do I know. &quot;
    I suppose I could. However, delaying this any further will make it hard for the both of us. 
    
    He looks at me again, and asks, &quot; Can you tell me more? &quot;.
