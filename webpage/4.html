    He lets out a small sigh. &quot; All right, I understand &quot;. The light fades from the room as a cloud passes by. He stares at his hands, opening and closing them rythmically, as if he&#39;s having a conversation with them.
    Then, almost as if his hands gave him the idea, asks, &quot; What about my family? &quot;.
    
    Lester, my grandfather, was a man I&#39;d never met in my life until now. My mom would always scorn when I asked her about him. I&#39;d only ever heard about him from my grandmom. She had told me that he was a scientist, and that although he was never really around the family much, he really did love us. I never got to meet him because he was busy with his research right up until he died.
    I dont&#39; know what he did to trouble my mom, but he doesn&#39;t seem that bad.  Lester seems to be the kind of guy you&#39;d want to have conversations about the universe with. Maybe he got worse with age? 
    
    He looks at me with a more concerned look. &quot; Am I there for my children, for you? In the future? &quot;.
    
    Should I tell him the truth? Maybe I should lie. These are his last moments. Maybe lying to him will make him feel better.
