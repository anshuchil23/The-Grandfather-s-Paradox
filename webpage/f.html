    I put my blaster back in my jacket pocket. I pick up the pistol. It&#39;s old. It is covered in dust. How is it still so shiny? He sits down and lets out a sigh. 
    He takes off his plaid jacket and sets it down on the floor. Crossing his hands on the table, he looks at me and nods as if to say he&#39;s ready. 
    I look at Lester one last time. It feels like I&#39;ve swallowed a stone. I gulp. Ready with the pistol aimed at him, I say, &quot; Thank you for this. &quot;. He smiles proudly and replies, &quot; No, thank you &quot;. 
    
    I shoot Lester in the head.
