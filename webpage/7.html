    &quot; You were there for every birthday party, every family gathering. You with with us till your dying breath, Lester.&quot;, I told him. He chuckled. He looked at me with a smile on his face. &quot; I wasn&#39;t there for anyone was I? &quot;, he questioned rhetorically. How did he know I was lying?. &quot; You&#39;re a horrible liar, my dear grandson &quot;, he pointed out. 

    So I told him the truth. His expression staying constant throughout. By the end of it all, he made a face as if to say &#39;Just as I expected&#39;. He goes to the kitchen and opens a drawer. He picks out what looked like a photograph, kisses it and lays it back in the drawer. Was that a photograph of my grandmother? Why was this affectionate person so indifferent to my mother as a child. Why would he prioritise his research over his family if he loved them so much? All of these questions started buzzing about inside of my head. Lester interrupted me by giving a nod to tell me that he&#39;s ready. I nod in agreement. He looks at me one final time and says &quot;Thank You for letting me do this&quot;. 
    I take out my blaster, I aim it at him, I look into his eyes; I can&#39;t pull the trigger. My hands are shaking. I drop my blaster on the floor. 
    Lester looks at me shocked.
    &quot;You could have a second chance, Lester. Make things right with mom. Bring her up well. You could lead a normal life. Maybe the result of this experiment isn&#39;t as important as we think it is&quot;, I say to Lester. 
    Sunlight starts to fill the room again, gradually.
    He sighs. Not a sigh of relief. More like a sigh of disappointment. Was he looking forward to this? Why would he be disappointed. Numerous thoughts were flowing through my head. 
    Lester walks towards the kitchen again. He opens the drawer. With his back towards me, he says, &quot; I had a feeling you would pussy out in one of these &quot;. I can&#39;t understand what he&#39;s saying. One of what? 
    He turns around. The light reflected off of it makes it look pristine. Lester was staring down the barrel of a pistol. 
    He looked at me once again with dead fish eyes. He pulls the pistol up to his head. Before I can scream for him to stop, he shoots himself. Lester died.
