    &quot; I&#39;m sorry Lester &quot;, I say. &quot; This is the first time I&#39;m meeting you &quot;.
    His brows frown. He looks at me and asks, &quot; Do I die before you&#39;re born? &quot;. 
    I found that funny, so I chuckled and replied, &quot; Don&#39;t worry Lester you died much later &quot;. I looked at him expecting a laugh. Lester was not laughing. He wore a serious look on his face, almost as if disappointed. 
    &quot; You die in your eighties, Lester, there is nothing to worry about &quot;, I remark. He looks at me and says, &quot; Doesn&#39;t that make it worse? I didn&#39;t even make the effort to meet you, my own grandson &quot;. He pauses, sighs, and mutters under his breath &quot; Classic old me &quot;.
    I felt bad. Maybe I should have lied to him after all. There was no reason for Lester to die filled with regret. 
    Lester walked towards the kitchen. He opens a drawer and picks out what seems like a photograph. He brings it to the table, but doesn&#39;t show it to me. &quot;And how about your grandmother? &quot;, he asks me. &quot; Oh she was the only one who backed you up when you weren&#39;t around. Grandma lived a happy life and passed peacefully at the age of ninety one&quot;, I replied. He swayed his fingers across the picture and smiled. 
    
    After a pause, Lester asks, &quot; When is your birthday? &quot;. How did he know. There was no way he could have known. &quot; Today &quot;, I reply. He smiled again.
    
    &quot;Then let me do this for you. This is my gift to you; for all the birthday parties I missed.&quot;, he says.
    With a hint of disapproval, I reply, &quot; Killing your grandfather isn&#39;t really the best birthday gift &quot;. He laughs. I laugh. 
    The laughter dies and then he signals to me with a nod that he is ready. I take out my blaster and aim it at him. He tells me, &quot; Thank you for letting me do this &quot;. 
    
    I shoot him. Lester dies.
