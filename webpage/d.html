    He stands in the kitchen, holding what seemed to be a photo. I see only his back. His medium sized frame cast a large shadow across the room. He kisses the photo and lays it down.  
    He walks towards the dining table with an air of confidence akin to one who has let go of all their troubles.
    
    &quot; I&#39;m ready- &quot;, he pauses, &quot;-thank you for this&quot;.
    
    Lester&#39;s room felt so alien. The wooden dining table; probably oak, or walnut, maybe mahogany. A Turkish carpet hiding under it, alongside bits of crackers. The room was not extravagant. It was self-sufficient. The window opening the house to an overwhelmingly bright, but beautiful countryside green. The light inside the house, refracted throught Lester&#39;s beakers and test tubes painted strokes on the wall.
    
    
    
    I pull out my blaster and aim it at him.
    
    I look at Lester one last time but not long enough to change my decision.
    
    I shoot Lester and he disintegrates into dust.
