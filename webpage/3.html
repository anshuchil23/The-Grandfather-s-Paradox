    He frowns. Rubbing his forehead, he exclaims, &quot; Oh come on! What changes can a dead man make to the timeline! &quot;. He had a point. I am going to kill him. 

    I look at him, his face painted by the light, full of curiosity. I suppose I could tell him a little. 
    
    I lean over to him, signalling with my hands that what I&#39;m about to say is a secret. He leans over to me with a look that says &#39; I can handle this &#39;.
    
    &quot; Quantum.. &quot;, I pause to tease him, &quot; ...Supremacy &quot;. The silence in the room is coupled with the flabbergasted look on Lester&#39;s face. He leans back into his chair, dumbfounded. 
    Finally, he breaks the silence. Looking at me, laughing hysterically, he exclaims, &quot; Quantum Supremacy!!! &quot;. And again, &quot; Quantum... &quot;, he pauses, &quot;...Supremacy!!! &quot;. And then again, quizzically, &quot; Quantum Supremacy... &quot;
    
    I couldn&#39;t help but laugh along with him, &quot; Isn&#39;t it amazing! Not enough people can grasp how amazing it actually is in my time. They just take it for granted &quot;, I complained. 
    
    Still shocked, he replies &quot; It&#39;s absolutely fantastic!!! &quot;. He continues, &quot; The possibilites! Oh! The bloody possibilities!! &quot;. 
    
    &quot; Unlimited!! &quot;, I reply excitedly. 
    
    And there we were. Two men of science regaling over the possibilites and certanties of the future, in the past.
    
    He looks at me again, and asks, &quot; Can you tell me more? &quot;.
