    He looks at me with a soft smile. A smile I thought I&#39;d never see. &quot; Tea helps calm the nerves &quot;, he notes as he pours me a cup of fragrant Darjeeling tea from a rustic china teapot. I hold the cup in my hand. I blow the steam off. I take a sip. The warmth flows through my mouth, down my throat. I feel relaxed. I shouldn&#39;t. Not right now. 

Lester&#39;s room felt so alien. The wooden dining table; probably oak, or walnut, maybe mahogany. A Turkish carpet hiding under it, alongside bits of crackers. The room was not extravagant. It was self-sufficient. The window opening the house to an overwhelmingly bright, but beautiful countryside green. The light inside the house, refracted through Lester&#39;s beakers and test tubes, painted strokes on the wall.
It was all so alien, but the Tea flowed through me and I felt at home.
